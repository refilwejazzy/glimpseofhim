Relentless, passion, this shit is not illusive  
Blood, sweat and tears  
You can hear it in the- (uh)  
It's not 'bout we going  
It's about how we getting to it  
Trap going up with the niggas shit we too lit  
Niggas keep asking like who dis  
And why he so nice with the bullseye - Cupid  
Me and Santana like DX on this joint  
Is it with me or him?  
Niggas couldn't pin point (uh)

Swag a little different, I'm cool as a breeze  
Nobody thought about me  
Until I started hopping on beats  
Gotta go hard as a bitch  
Studio set up a week  
This shit is not a routine  
It's just a version of me  
Gotta reset and redeem  
Everything meant for me  
And just like how short'a ka bois  
Man this is all I need  
Phone blowing up I don't recognize caller ID  
I'm upscaling like Dora mi fa so la ti do  
Ever since a jit, man I always wanted more  
Till I <b>D.I.E</b>   
Imma do whatever it <b>T.A.K.E</b>  
Just to reach the  <b>T.O.P</b>   
Shit will never fail, I'm surrounded by -  
Shit will never fail I'm surrounded by niggas who got it like that  
I just gotta fight back  
Tell Moms I'm running game  
Imma be right back  
We not just living the dream  
Shit we brought it right back (shit we brought it right back)  
Yeah...
